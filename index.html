        <h2>Snare Drums</h2>
        <p>
          The snare drum is one of the most essential pieces in a drum set. It
          produces a sharp, crisp sound; backbeat,and is often used to maintain
          the backbeat in all genres.

          <p>
            When you strike the top head, the vibration travels through the
            drum, but the snares add a buzzing, rattling texture that gives it
            that signature snap. It’s versatile too, ranging from tight, crisp
            hits to deeper, more resonant tones, depending on the tension of the
            wires and the drumhead. That snappy crack when drummers hit a
            rimshot or play a solid backbeat is what gives so much energy to
            rock, pop, and even jazz beats. It’s the heartbeat of a lot of
            drumming styles.

        <h2>Bass Drums</h2>
        <p>
          The bass drum, also known as the kick drum, provides the low-end
          foundation in a drum set. It produces a deep, booming sound and is
          typically played with a foot pedal.

        <p>
          Tom-tom drums, often referred to as toms, come in various sizes and
          produce different pitches. They are commonly used to add depth and
          texture to drum beats.

        <h2>Cymbals</h2>
        <p>
          Cymbals are percussion instruments that produce a shimmering, crashing
          sound. They come in various types, including crash cymbals, ride
          cymbals, and hi-hats.
        </p>
        <img src="cymbals.jpg" alt="Cymbals" />
        <div class="additional-info">
          <p>
            The hi-hat cymbals consist of two matching cymbals positioned
            face-to-face on a stand with a foot pedal. You use a piece of
            hardware called a clutch to connect the top cymbal to the stand.
            When closed, they produce a distinct note played with the stick or
            the foot. The pedal lets you bring them together for a tighter sound
            or open them up for a looser, louder feel. Hi-hats are on the
            smaller side compared to other cymbals, with the exception of the
            splash cymbal (a small effect cymbal).<br />
            Crashes come in a variety of sizes (16″-20″ are the most common) and
            are known for their explosive, high-pitched sound. Unlike the hi-hat
            and ride cymbals, which drummers use to maintain the beat, this
            cymbal is often used to emphasize or punctuate specific exciting
            moments or transitions in a musical piece. You can keep the pulse
            (also known as “riding”) on a crash cymbal as well, but unless you
            play rock or metal, you might find it too overpowering for the
            music.<br />
            The ride, typically the largest cymbal on a drum kit, produces a
            medium-to-high pitched sound. Like hi-hats, their primary role is
            maintaining a steady rhythm over a beat, though by laying into the
            edge you can also use them like big crashes. In addition to the
            above, splashes are the smallest cymbals in the kit with a loud,
            sharp, short-lived sound, and a China is a distinct effect cymbal
            with an explosive and low-pitched sound, usually mounted upside
            down.<br />

          The djembe is a West African drum with a goblet shape and a skin head.
          It is played with bare hands and produces a rich, resonant sound.
          Djembes are commonly used in traditional African music.
